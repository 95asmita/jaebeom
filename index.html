		<h2>About Jaebeom</h2>
		<p>Im Jaebeom, born in 1994, is the second oldest member and the leader of GOT7. He was previously a part of the duo known as JJ Project alongside his now GOT7 bandmate Park Jinyoung. The duo also tied at the finals of the JYP Entertainment open auditions. Jaebeom, who also goes by Def., prefers to live a quiet, quaint life when he isn't in the limelight as a member of the JYP boy group.</p>
